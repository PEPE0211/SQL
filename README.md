# Data Cleaning and EDA with SQL


## Introduction

This GitHub repository houses two SQL files that demonstrate data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on two distinct datasets. These SQL scripts serve as valuable resources for anyone interested in data manipulation, transformation, and analysis using SQL.

### 1. Nashville Housing Data Cleaning

The `nashville_housing_data_cleaning.sql` script showcases how to clean and prepare a dataset of Nashville housing data. The script covers various data cleaning techniques, such as handling missing values, removing duplicates, and standardizing data formats. The resulting cleaned dataset can be used for further analysis or modeling.

### 2. COVID-19 Data Exploratory Data Analysis

The `covid19_data_eda.sql` script provides an example of exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a COVID-19 dataset. It includes SQL queries to extract meaningful insights from the data, such as summarizing key statistics, visualizing trends, and identifying patterns in the COVID-19 data.
